#### [Issue 1]: Set Up Dev Enviornment

**What went well?–What didn’t go so well?**<br/><br/>
The Android project was easy to setup for me and going through the different builds of the project went smoothly. Though Forrest's development environment was difficult to setup. He had an issue with GitLab, so it caused issue with Android Studios as well. The issue with had something to do with the README file containing whitespace.

**What have I learned?**<br/><br/>
I learned that even when you **KNOW** things will go right there is always an issue. The rule that you should take the amount of time you think something code related should take and multiply it by three definitely applies. I learned what an Acitivity and Fragment is in Android. I also learned what Flutter is.

**What still puzzles me?**<br/><br/>
I am still uncertain on whether the group should really use Flutter. The time we have left is not a lot and there is a ton of work ahead to streamline the app. Additionally, we are using a language that none of us have every used before.

**What will we change to improve?**<br/><br/>
I will need to streamline the process developing on both iOS and Android. Additionally, the group needs to learn and implement Flutter at a rather quick pace.

#### [Issue 1]: Set Up Dev Enviornment
**Forrest Walsh**
<br/><br/>
**What went well?–What didn’t go so well?**<br/><br/>
This sprint I learned a lot about Flutter, and Android Studio in general. Getting the environments set up in Android studio went well. I had a little bit more trouble with setting up IOS test enviornments with Flutter, but I was able to get a working Flutter envoirnment on my Mac.

**What have I learned?**<br/><br/>
I learned some of the basics of working in Flutter and Dart. I also learned a lot about mobile development as this sprint is the first time I have done any mobile development. 

**What still puzzles me?**<br/><br/>
We are still having trouble imporiting the Android app to Flutter, but hopefully we can work this issue out in the next sprint so that we can work on both IOS and Android apps simultaneously. 

**What will we change to improve?**<br/><br/>
We will have to study and read more about Flutter and ways that we can combine both mobile enviornments. As it currently stands there are a lot of unknowns with Flutter development. 

#### [Issue]: Issue_5 branch
**Tyler Shingler**
<br/><br/>
**What went well?–What didn’t go so well?**<br/><br/>
I would have liked to have had more explicit documention for setting up the environment for the project. It also took me a while to understand that SSL certificates are needed for connecting properly.

**What have I learned?**<br/><br/>
I learned a lot about some the tomcat apache files and SSL. 

**What still puzzles me?**<br/><br/>
SSL certificates

**What will we change to improve?**<br/><br/>
Mostly at this point its about learning what's available, than what's not.
