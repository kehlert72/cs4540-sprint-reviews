## Sprint Review 11

#### Issue 23 and 25: Refresh Scorecard and Refresh Leaderboard
**Kaleb Ehlert**
<br/><br/>

**What went well?**<br/><br/>
We were able to get the scorecard to refresh without drastically changing anything.

**What didn’t go so well?**<br/><br/>
We tried to get the leaderboard to refresh, but are stuck on how to get it done. We spent all week on trying to get both the scorecard to refresh and the leaderboard to as well. Though the scorecard does refresh.

**What have I learned?**<br/><br/>
That state management can be a pain to deal with and that it is really important for a programming language to make that as easy as possible.

**What still puzzles me?**<br/><br/>
Why the team before us decided to use a three dimensional array when the majority of the information is useless. They should have just made several request to get all the data if they really want all that data.

**What will we change to improve?**<br/><br/>
The API needs some serious rework and the state management for flutter could really be improved. Also, the page should automatically refresh when it comes back into the foreground and the user can interact with that page again.

#### Issue: 24 & 22
**Tyler Shingler**
<br/><br/>

**What went well?**<br/><br/>
I finnally understand what was going on with the API and was able to update the documentation with for the end of the class.

**What didn’t go so well?**<br/><br/>

It just took a bit to get to where I'm at. I wish I could have dont more but It just took long to understand because I didn't understand any of how php and its ecosystems of frameworks work at the beginning of the class.

**What have I learned?**<br/><br/>

I've learned a lot about how php works and how apache works and how to configure it.

**What still puzzles me?**<br/><br/>

Not much right now.

**What will we change to improve?**<br/><br/>

I think that the way route work could stand to be re-organized.
