## Sprint Review 9

#### Issue 9: Leaderboard and Score card
**Kaleb Ehlert**
<br/><br/>

**What went well?**<br/><br/>
We were able to refactor the UI and prototype the leaderboard and score card UI. Passing information from one class to another was easier done than expected.

**What didn’t go so well?**<br/><br/>
We struggled with retrieving the leaderboard and score card UI. The API combines too many tables into the teams table. To retrieve this data it should have been broken out into several queries.

**What have I learned?**<br/><br/>
I learned that coding is very time consuming as I spent an entire day on prototyping the leaderboard and score card UI. Additionally, I learned the importance of the JOIN command as the API joins too many tables together. This was puzzling and frustrating to try and solve.

**What still puzzles me?**<br/><br/>
I do not understand what the group who built the API was thinking. This was very poorly done and is confusing to look at. They REALLY need to learn to comment their code.

**What will we change to improve?**<br/><br/>
I cannot think of what needs to be changed to improve, however, the API needs to be refactored.

#### Issue: Leaderboard and ScoreCard
**Forrest Walsh**
<br/><br/>

**What went well?**<br/><br/>
We were able to get a lot done this week with reguards to pulling data from the database, updating the UI to look better, and putting the data in the UI.
I figured out how to mess with the API to our advantage, plus we will need most of the data that we thought would be unused for calculations. I am not a big fan of how the API works, but upon using it I don't think we should spend time refactoring the JSON files. 

**What didn’t go so well?**<br/><br/>
The way that I got the data in the program might be a little sloppy so we will likely have a lot of refactoring to do. On top of this we also need to be able to modify the values based on user input.
I completely disreguarded that as I was still working with the API and learning.

**What have I learned?**<br/><br/>
I learned how to access data stored in a JSON format. I learned a little bit about sliver lists, but Kaleb primarily focused on that. I also learned some how to solve issues with the IOS app through Flutter commands.

**What still puzzles me?**<br/><br/>
I am not sure why there is no Rank in the database I would think a team would need a rank, but I need to think about it more.
I am also not sure why so much calculation will be left up to the app as the Rank, total Score and other variables will need to be calculated. 

**What will we change to improve?**<br/><br/>
Try not getting frustrated when things don't make any sense. We should also observer the previous team's code more as it is extremely helpful with the API. I would have never found out how to access data if I hadn't used a line of code that made almost no sense to me into our program.


#### Issue: Issues 18 & 19 & come api help
**Tyler Shingler**
<br/><br/>

**What went well?**<br/><br/>
Getting the gitrepo set up was pretty straight forward and cool. Its nice to have all that commited now. 

**What didn’t go so well?**<br/><br/>
I had this issue with the command `composer install` but I've put it a shell script, to get everything in order.

**What have I learned?**<br/><br/>
I leanred more about git submodals and how php extentions work. Not sure how confident in how much I know about php extentions are.

**What still puzzles me?**<br/><br/>
Pdo db drivers.

**What will we change to improve?**<br/><br/>
I think that I could learn more about how php extnetion and how this pdo is installed.
