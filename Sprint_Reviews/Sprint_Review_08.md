## Sprint Review 8

#### Issue 12 and 15: Refeactor Login Connection and Login Page
**Kaleb Ehlert**
<br/><br/>
**What went well?–What didn’t go so well?**<br/><br/>
We were able to complete the login page, but it was complicated and confusing. The API connection was working the entire time, but the values in the UI fields were not retrieved. Then, we thought the data was not being retrieved properly, however, we were not getting the correct values, so we kept getting null values.

**What have I learned?**<br/><br/>
I learned how the API response and request connection works for the login page.

**What still puzzles me?**<br/><br/>
I still confused on how these values for the leaderboard should be retrieved by the http.response. I see what data is returned, but I am uncertain I am doing this properly.

**What will we change to improve?**<br/><br/>
We need a snackbar for notify that the user failed to login or that they need to fill in their login credentials.


#### [Issue]: Refactor Login Connection and Login Page, Leaderboard and Scorecard
**Forrest Walsh**
<br/><br/>
**What went well?–What didn’t go so well?**<br/><br/>
Working with the API went fairly well this week, the only main issues we had with the login page is that we were not properly handling the data that we pulled from the API. The main things that didn't go well for me this week was working with the leaderboard and lists for them.

**What have I learned?**<br/><br/>
I learned a lot about working with the Townie Cup API and connecting .JSON files to a Flutter app. I also learned a lot about working with the UI of Flutter apps, and the many different options that you can use.

**What still puzzles me?**<br/><br/>
What we pull from the Leaderboard still confuses me. I don't understand how we handle that data yet and how we will connect an input to the data that we pull for the scorecard. The Login was fairly simple so I probably just need to think a little harder.

**What will we change to improve?**<br/><br/>
I hope to use the Flutter website in more effective ways so that I can learn more complex and better looking ways to format apps.

#### [Issue]: Issue_5
**Tyler Shingler**
<br/><br/>
**What went well?–What didn’t go so well?**<br/><br/>
I worked with apache to get all the projects working the same project, and serving on different subdomains. It took a while seeing as I got working down the wrong path, but after finding my way it was not too bad.

**What have I learned?**<br/><br/>
I've learned alot about apache, how it work and how flexiable it can witch is realy useful. 

**What still puzzles me?**<br/><br/>
Some of the proxy and reverse proxy stuff looks really cool but I still would have to fiddle with it to understand it.

**What will we change to improve?**<br/><br/>
I'm, looking to add a new repo so the docker-compose.yaml and dockerfile can be included for envsetup.


### [Issue]: 11 Rework UI
**Byron Ragland**
<br/><br/>
**What went well?–What didn’t go so well?**<br/>
We were able to work on the login page and make some changes to it allowing you to skip straight to the dashboard from
the login page.<br/>
**What have I learned?**<br/>
I learned some key funcationalities of flutter with the use of things like future classes and I also learned how to format buttons with the purpose of navigating tto desired locations within the app.<br/>
**What still puzzles me?**<br/>
I was getting an error with the APIToolBox in my Android Studio after pulling the latest changes from the repository. Also the logout functionality doesn' really do anything right now.<br/>
**What will we change to improve?**<br/>
We will work on the leaderboard and how to pull data with API.<br/>
