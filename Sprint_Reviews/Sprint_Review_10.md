## Sprint Review 10

#### Issue 20: Scorecard
**Kaleb Ehlert**
<br/><br/>

**What went well?**<br/><br/>

Reworking the scorecard class to be implemeted for the use of the different teams. Additionally, creating the dialogs was not too difficult as well.

**What didn’t go so well?**<br/><br/>
The refresh functionality is still not working. There were several bugs that poped up with the navigation that consumed a bunch of time as well.

**What have I learned?**<br/><br/>
That you should always pick code that can be quickly refactored if there is not a reason to optimize the code.

**What still puzzles me?**<br/><br/>
I cannot figure out why the refresh functionality is not working.

**What will we change to improve?**<br/><br/>
We need to refactor a decent amount of code and add more tests.

#### Issue: 20 Scorecard
**Forrest Walsh**
<br/><br/>

**What went well?**<br/><br/>

Working on the scorecard this week went really well. We were finally able to get the scorecard to actually send data to the database.

**What didn’t go so well?**<br/><br/>

The main issues we had this week revolve around updating the scorecard with the new data once the input dialog closes.

**What have I learned?**<br/><br/>

To thoroughly look through existing code when I run into issues. A big problem with sending the data to the API was because I was using the wrong link. If I had looked at the previous team's code more I would have realized this sooner and probably would have saved an hour. 

**What still puzzles me?**<br/><br/>

Myself and Kaleb are fairly confused as to how we will go about updating the scorecard. The way Flutter works makes this slightly more difficult than the solutions I looked for in the other code. 

**What will we change to improve?**<br/><br/>

Try to solve the updating issue with the existing code instead of reinventing the wheel. The only issue with this is that Flutter is quite different from the other code. 

#### Issue: 18 & 19
**Tyler Shingler**
<br/><br/>

**What went well?**<br/><br/>

Finally got all websites serving most of their content!


**What didn’t go so well?**<br/><br/>

The API needs work, it would seem that only the '/' route works.

**What have I learned?**<br/><br/>

I've learned a lot about how pip extentions work and the php.ini works.

**What still puzzles me?**<br/><br/>

What exectly is going wrong with the API

**What will we change to improve?**<br/><br/>

The API implementaions.
