## Sprint Review 7

#### Issue 10: Refactoring
**Kaleb Ehlert**
<br/><br/>

**What went well?–What didn’t go so well?**<br/><br/>
Moving the code into separate files and cleaning up the code went smoothly. The home page, however, did not go well. After six hours we had to scrap everything and rethink what we were doing. 

**What have I learned?**<br/><br/>
Always plan on something going wrong in development because if something does not go wrong you are doing something wrong.

**What still puzzles me?**<br/><br/>
How the API connection works is still puzzling. Also, how the API is supposed to keep things secure is also puzzling.

**What will we change to improve?**<br/><br/>
We need to improve our skills in Dart development. The code we started out with in the first week was messy and bloated. Everything was in one file and we really did not understand what was going on. We were just trying to get something built.

#### Issue 9 & 10: Refactoring & Leaderboard
**Forrest Walsh**

**What went well?–What didn’t go so well?**<br/><br/>
This week we had many things go well with the project. We were able to rework the UI a bit more making it more simplistic. We still need to make the Login Page be the first page that the user confronts. We were also able to make a connection with the Townie Cup API. The main things that didn't go well was that we are still trying to make the login page completely functional. I am also having issues setting the app icon however I hope to get this done next sprint.

**What have I learned?**<br/><br/>
This sprint I learned a lot more about Flutter and Dart. I also learned more about making connections with APIs. Next sprint I hope to fully learn how to access and check credentials with the API.

**What still puzzles me?**<br/><br/>
The main aspect that puzzles me is how the login page will function. What I mean is I am not completely understanding how the two text fields in our app will be able to match passwords and usernames in the database. I am sure we will come to a solution in the next sprint the more I work with the API.

**What will we change to improve?**<br/><br/>
I feel fairly comfortable with the API right now but if myself and Kaleb continue having issues we will have to work with Tyler more. I also feel that we need to keep track of our issues more as this week we started on the login page which didnt have a specific issue tied to it yet.

#### [Issue]: Issue 8
**Tyler Shingler**
<br/><br/>
**What went well?–What didn’t go so well?**<br/><br/>
This week I finally was able to get those sites working in docker containers. I still have to get this PDO driver working however considering my conversation with Dr Green.
I'd rather opt for learning about how apache supports subdomains.
**What have I learned?**<br/><br/>
I'v leaned my understanding of apachy is incomplete, and is far more flexable than I thought witch I think is great.
**What still puzzles me?**<br/><br/>
How this ssl issues came about in the first place.
**What will we change to improve?**<br/><br/>
Server configuration to support subdomains.
