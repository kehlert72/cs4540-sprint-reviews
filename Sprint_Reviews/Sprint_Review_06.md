**What went well?–What didn’t go so well?**<br/><br/>
The documentation was well put together and easy to navigate. There are plenty of videos on Flutter to help as well. Ultimately, getting the UI for Flutter was much easier than originally anticipated. What did not go so well is trying to replicate exactly what previous group had accomplished for the UI. Due to differences and inexperience with Flutter, the UI is sitll a work in progress with Flutter.

**What have I learned?**<br/><br/>
I have learned that I did not know as much as I thought I knew about Android. Also, that some languages are easier to learn than others. I originally thought it would takes weeks to get the UI up and running, but it took only a week to get a working prototype running.

**What still puzzles me?**<br/><br/>
I still do not understand how Flutter is still organized entirely. The child and similar syntax does not make much sense on how that works. When I think I understand the structure for that it breaks.

**What will we change to improve?**<br/><br/>
We need to refactor the UI even further and meet with Dr. Green to see where the UI needs to go. Also, we need to figure out how we can communicate with the database to get the most integral part of the app working. We will also need to work on testing for the app shortly.

Learning Flutter was interesting and we were able to replicate the current Android UI to work on both IOS and Android phones through flutter. Unfortunately I had some issues getting the original IOS version working so I haven't seen the major changes that were made with that version of the app. I will try to acomplish this before the demo on Monday but I imagine that I will not get it working in time.

**What have I learned?**<br/><br/>
I learned a lot about Flutter this week. The week started off very frustrating, but as soon as we were able to combine the build and get it on Git most of our issues disappeared. I also learned that I enjoy building GUI's in Flutter but I still have a lot to learn in order to make perfect UIs. I also learned a good bit about Git by using the import functionality, and the merge. I am no longer as afraid of mergers as I once was now that I have experience handling them.

**What still puzzles me?**<br/><br/>
Swift and Xcode still puzzles me. I am also fairly intimidated by the idea of adding the logic and functionalty to Flutter. There are a lot of unknowns in this situation and I am worried that we will have to overcome a lot of hurdles. 

**What will we change to improve?**<br/><br/>
I will no longer be as afraid of merges as VScode handles them quite well. This means I can be much more productive in pair programming as I am not as concerned with breaking the program. I will try not to give up on working in Xcode as quickly as I did this week. We also need to be more communitave with Tyler and Byron so that we can try and help them with any issues they run into.

#### Issue #8: Dockerizing admin site

**What went well?–What didn’t go so well?**<br/><br/>
Lost of issues with ssl, that not sure how they were resovled. I did however get the site up and working after abit before discovering some missing submoduals. Progress!
**What have I learned?**<br/><br/>
I learned alot about ssl and CA's. 
**What still puzzles me?**<br/><br/>
Why those ssl problems were happening. They are gone now but I still have no idea.
**What will we change to improve?**<br/><br/>
No really sure how I would avoid that ghost ssl problem.
