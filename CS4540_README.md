This project has different feature branches that contains a specific issue. Those feature branches will then be merged to the master branch once the feature is complete and fully tested.

The development process consists of each week being considered a sprint. The sprints consists of a issues that can either be solved that week. If they cannot be accomplished within a week, than it has to be broken down into several other issues. If an issue is too complicated, than pair programming is implemented for that issue. This helps cover each other's mistakes, as well as, allow for them to cover more ground.
