## Sprint 7

#### Navigation Test (Manual Test)

The navigation works as it is supposed to. You can navigate from the home page to any of the other pages, but you have to click back first to navigate to other pages.

#### API Connection

In this sprint we added a new function to the program which tests to see if we have made a successful connection to the Townie Cup API.



## Sprint 8

#### API Connection (Manual Test)

The connection kept failing as the variables were still set to NULL when the connection was made. The variables are now assigned the appropriate values from the appropriate fields.



#### Login Page Test

This ensure that the main appbar, email textfieldform, password textfieldform, and sign in button exists.



#### Dashboard Test

This ensures that the leader board, website, contact us, and log out buttons exist for the leader board page. Additionally, it tests that the tap functionality of the buttons work. The results have already been manually tested in Sprint 7 as there is no other way to automate this that we are aware of.



## Sprint 9

We created the UI for leader board and score card, as well as, refacored the UI. Additionally, we created an API connection for the leader board and score card. We ran into several issues trying to retrieve the information for the leader board and the score card, as well as, passing information from one page to the next.



#### Passing Data (Manual Test)

We passed user login information from the login page to the dashboard.



#### Retrieve Information For Score Card (Manual Test)

This ensured that the API sent the correct data and that the variables are not null.



#### Retrieve Information For Leader Board (Manual Test)

This ensured that the API sent the correct data and that the variables are not null.



## Sprint 10

#### Navigation (Manual Test)

We had a few errors with passing context to several functions and we also had to test the score cards that were added to the leaderboard functionality.





## Sprint 11

#### ScoreCard Refresh (Manual Test)

Ensures that the scorecard will refresh and there are no bugs with the refresh functionality.
